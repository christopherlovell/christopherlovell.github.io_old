Even if you haven't heard of this book or its author, you've certainly heard or used many of the terms and concepts it introduced to the English language, such as *Cyberpunk*, *the Matrix*, *hacking* & *Cyberspace*. The final one has since been used to describe many other worlds, both fictional in the many cyberpunk novels it inspired in the 1980s, and now very real - the internet has familiarised almost everyone on the planet with virtual worlds, and the vast amounts of uncontrolled data they contain.

The story describes a hacker called Armitage, who is hired by a shady organisation to ...
He's joined by a host of futuristic characters; mind controlled ex-army officers, bio-tech enhanced mercenaries, and shape shifting psychopaths. Each of these character traits is introduced carefully, and any technology or far-flung concepts are always there for a reason, rather than for aesthetics. The prose is fast and jargon filled, which relays a sense of the pace of the world at this time, and the opaque and technological language that English has evolved in to.

To give a sense of how ahead of its time this book was, Gibson wrote it on a typewriter. Networked computers were still confined in university labs.


Possibly the most widely known interpretation of the genre, or at least of a cyberspace future, is the Wachowski brothers film *The Matrix*. Neuromancer differs in that the virtual world is a consensual one, where humans can jack in or out as they please. It is also completely unlike anything in the real world, with streams of data representing the topography of this virtual world. I guess the green 'code' that Neo sees in the Matrix films is the nearest representation in film of the kind of world Gibson invented.
