Just been to an event organised by Microsoft to show off their new data products. This is the first Microsoft event I've been to but speaking to other attendees I got the impression that this was an organisation that's far more open to debate and competition than previously; Hortonworks were in attendance to show off their products and take part in the Q&A, on an equal footing with Microsoft representatives. 

Possibly the biggest announcement at the event was that Revolution R, the largest R enterprise vendors, have very recently been snapped up by Microsoft. Exciting for those already signed up to the Microsoft stack; I had a chance to play with the new Azure Machine Learning tool, which was very slick and easy to use, and has R extensions built in already.

It is perhaps a bit worrying for existing R users - Revolution have given so much back to the R community, the question is whether that will continue under their new masters.
