Just been to an event organised by *Microsoft* to show off their new data products. This is the first Microsoft event I've been to but speaking to other attendees I got the impression that this was an organisation that's far more open to debate and competition than previously; Hortonworks were in attendance to show off their products and take part in the Q&A, on an equal footing with Microsoft representatives. 

Possibly the biggest announcement at the event was that Revolution R, the largest R enterprise vendors, have very recently been snapped up by Microsoft. What does this mean for existing R users?
