excerpt: A look back at one of the great scientific controversies; Lord Kelvin's thermal timescale for the age of the Sun and the Earth.
---

The story of how scientists discovered the age of the earth is a remarkable one. At the beginning of the nineteenth century many still believed that the earth had been around forever, but by the early twentieth century the definitive source of the sun's heat had been discovered, and evidence from fields as diverse as geology and biology had been united. Perhaps what makes the story even more fascinating are the egos and personalities that shaped it, and none more so than that of William Thomson, aka Lord Kelvin.

Lord Kelvin was possibly the most eminent scientist of his day, famous today for the temperature scale that bears his name. But it was his work on thermodynamics that led him to ponder the question of the age of the earth. He saw an opportunity to apply the recently formulated laws of thermodynamics to the problem, in particular the first law, which states:

>  The total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but cannot be created or destroyed

This is the principle of conservation of energy.

He sought to apply this principle to calculate the age of the Sun; Kelvin held the view that the Earth had been formed after the Sun, and so by limiting the age of the Sun he could imply upper limits on the age of the Earth.

The Sun shines, and pretty brightly at that, so in assuming the principle of conservation of energy we imply that the Sun must have a source for this radiated energy. Kelvin's theory for the source of this energy was *gravitational contraction*; when a body contracts under its own gravity it releases energy, and according to Kelvin it was this energy that powered the Sun.

We can calculate how much energy the Sun could possibly radiate if it collapsed from its current state with a little school level math and some Newtonian Mechanics.

**Warning:** If you are allergic to Maths, feel free to skip the next bit. You don't need it to follow the story, but I'd certainly recommend running through it if you can; it's a beautiful, if flawed, argument!

We first define the [gravitational potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#Gravitational_potential_energy) from Newtonian mechanics,

<center>
$U = - \frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r}$
</center>

Where $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are two masses whose centers of gravity are separated by a distance $r$.

To apply this definition to the Sun we must first think of it as a series of concentric shells, each of radius $dr$. In this case, for a single shell at radius $r$, $m_{1}$ is the mass of the star within radius $r$, and $m_{2}$ is the mass of the shell itself.

<center><i>Concentric shells at radius $r$, width $dr$.</i></center>

We can then add up the contributions from all of the shells to give the total gravitational potential energy of the entire star.

His first assertion, that the Sun has not existed forever, seems obvious now, but it was not widely accepted at the time.
