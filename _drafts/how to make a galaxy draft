Of this physics, it is the physics of star formation with which we are interested in here, in particular a theory known as stochastic self-propagating star formation ([SSPSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSPSF_model)). This theory states that star formation is induced by shockwaves in the molecular gas of a galaxy. These shockwaves can be caused by stellar winds, strong outflows of radiation and matter from stars that applies pressure on the surrounding material, or supernovae, the violent deaths of massive stars. Researchers since the 1970's have suggested that the variety of visible properties of spiral galaxies shown in the Hubble sequence is a consequence of large scale star formation, and not of the stars themselves ([Gerola & Seiden, 1978](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978ApJ...223..129G)). This is an important distinction, since if we know how to model star formation then we can use this to model galaxy morphology.

The aim of this project was to model a spiral galaxy, and since the morphology according to SSPSF is due to star formation I began my model with the materials to make stars, Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs). I then arranged these in a disc, and applied a spiral density wave to set up the spiral structure.  

The following animation shows them whizzing around due to the gravity of the galaxy, modelled as a disc, bulge and dark matter halo






I thought the best way of approaching this post would be to break up the abstract in to sentences, and explain the science in each part separately. 

> Molecular gas and cluster formation of a galaxy is modelled, to try and understand and describe the structure of galaxies, in particular those with a grand 2-arm spiral shape.<

Like all good abstracts it gets straight to the point, which is that this was a modelling project, the subject being spiral galaxies. Below is a top down view of the final product, a disc of molecular clouds forming spiral arms over time.

> Spiral and disc galaxy morphology is reviewed, research into the history of stochastic self-propagating star formation (SSPSF) is made, and conclusions from previous literature applied and reviewed in the context of our model.<

Nobody really understands 

> An external satellite galaxy is also imposed, both separately and conjointly with the spiral density wave, which leads to a more flocculent structure at larger radii in both instances. <

> It does not create grand spiral arms, but does lead to condensed arms structure that matches very closely with Lindblad radii calculated. <

> Without either of these imposed potentials, the structure is near uniform, with minor flocculence at the edges of the disc. Short lived spiral structure occurs, but is quickly sheared out by differential rotation.<

> The efficiency of GMC collision induced star formation is reviewed from luminosity data, as well as the effects of imposed potentials on star formation rates and the possibilities of starbursting behaviour. <

> Finally, future additions to the model are established, researched, and potential problems considered. <
