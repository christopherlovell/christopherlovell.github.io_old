Recently attended an event by Microsoft on their new '[Data Culture](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/enterprise/event/Microsoft-Data-Culture-series.aspx#fbid=Ni4pj_8ywP9)', as championed by [Mr. Nadella himself](http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2014/04/15/a-data-culture-for-everyone/), and the shiny new toys associated with it. This is the first Microsoft event I've been to and it was a pretty relaxed and open affair; a change on previous years according to some punters.

Possibly the biggest announcement of the event was that Revolution R, the largest R enterprise vendors, have very recently been snapped up by Microsoft; very exciting for those already signed up to the Microsoft stack. I had a chance to play with the new [Azure Machine Learning tool](https://studio.azureml.net/), which was very slick and easy to use, and has R extensions built in already.

Excited to see the fruits of this relationship, and how R moves out from the academic underground.
