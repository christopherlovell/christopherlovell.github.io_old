My girlfriend Annie and I went away to Hong Kong and Dubai earlier this year. Rather than trotting out the usual Facebook holiday photo album I thought I'd do something a little different with our snaps this time. [Odyssey.js](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/) is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to weave maps and narrative together in to an interactive story. With a little tweaking and tuning to make the text box larger, and the pictures small enough to load quickly, I've created a fun little web app.

The image below links to the app.
