Just updated the design of this blog.  Used a free github pages template from [phuse](http://phuse.ca/), a design company, called [strange_case](https://github.com/thephuse/strange_case). The default comes with a pained portrait of Mr. Hyde, which I quickly swapped out for a less(?) disturbing image, the [Hubble deep field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field). I also updated my code highlighter, based on [this great guide](http://kvurd.com/blog/my-jekyll-blog-setup-bootstrap-sass-pygments/); it now highlights by language, and has a little scroll bar at the bottom if the lines get too long. cute.

In doing this update I refreshed my CSS and JS knowledge, and learnt what [asdfasdfasdfasdf](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=asdfasdfasdfasdf) means. Good job.
